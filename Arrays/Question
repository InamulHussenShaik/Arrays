Merge elements of 2 arrays into a 3rd array:
Problem: We have two arrays, and we want to combine them into a third array.
Approach: We will create a third array that has a size equal to the sum of the sizes
of the first two arrays. We'll then copy all elements from the first array to the 
third array, and then continue where we left off by copying all elements from the 
second array to the third array.


Calculate the sum of corresponding elements of an array and store in a 3rd array:
Problem: We're given two arrays of the same size, and we want to create a third array such that each element in this array is the sum of the corresponding elements in the first two arrays.
Approach: We will create a third array that is the same size as the first two arrays. We'll then go through a for loop where we add the corresponding elements of the first two arrays and store
the result in the third array.
